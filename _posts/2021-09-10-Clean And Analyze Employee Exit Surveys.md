## Introduction
In this project, we'll clean and analyze exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) body of the Queensland government in Australia. The TAFE exit survey can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).

We'll pretend our stakeholders want us to combine the results for both surveys to answer the following question:

* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

## Introduction
First, we'll read in the datasets and do some initial exporation. Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the `dete_survey.csv`:

* `ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey
* `SeparationType`: The reason why the person's employment ended
* `Cease Date`: The year or month the person's employment ended
* `DETE Start Date`: The year the person began employment with the DETE

Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the `tafe_survey.csv`:

* `Record ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey
* `Reason for ceasing employment`: The reason why the person's employment ended
* `LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years)`: The length of the person's employment (in years)


```python
#Read in the data
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
dete_survey = pd.read_csv('dete_survey.csv')

#Quick exploration of the data
pd.options.display.max_columns = 150 #to avoid truncated output
dete_survey.head()
```

We can make the following observations based on the work above:

* The `dete_survey` dataframe contains `'Not Stated'` values that indicate values are missing, but they aren't represented as NaN.
* Both the `dete_survey` and `tafe_survey` contain many columns that we don't need to complete our analysis.
* Each dataframe contains many of the same columns, but the column names are different.
* There are multiple columns/answers that indicate an employee resigned because they were dissatisfied.

## Identify Missing Values and Drop Unneccessary Columns
First, we'll correct the Not Stated values and drop some of the columns we don't need for our analysis.


```python
#Read in the data again, but this time read `not stated` values as `NaN`
dete_survey = pd.read_csv('dete_survey.csv', na_values = 'Not Stated')

#Quick exploration of the data
dete_survey.head()
```

## Rename Columns
Next, we'll standardize the names of the columns we want to work with, because we eventually want to combine the dataframes.


```python
#Clean the column names for dete_survey
dete_survey_updated.columns = dete_survey_updated.columns.str.lower().str.strip().str.replace(' ','_')

#Check that column names are updated correctly
dete_survey_updated.columns
```

## Filter the Data
For this project, we'll only analyze survey respondents who resigned, so we'll only select separation types containing the string `'Resignation'`.


```python
# Check the unique values for the separationtype column in tafe_survey_updated
tafe_survey_updated['separationtype'].value_counts()
```




    Resignation                 340
    Contract Expired            127
    Retrenchment/ Redundancy    104
    Retirement                   82
    Transfer                     25
    Termination                  23
    Name: separationtype, dtype: int64




```python
# Check the unique values for the separationtype column in dete_survey_updated
dete_survey_updated['separationtype'].value_counts()
```




    Age Retirement                          285
    Resignation-Other reasons               150
    Resignation-Other employer               91
    Resignation-Move overseas/interstate     70
    Voluntary Early Retirement (VER)         67
    Ill Health Retirement                    61
    Other                                    49
    Contract Expired                         34
    Termination                              15
    Name: separationtype, dtype: int64




```python
# Update all separations types containing 'resignation- ....' to one single column "Resignation"
dete_survey_updated['separationtype'] = dete_survey_updated['separationtype'].str.split('-').str[0]

# Check the values in the separationtype column were updated correctly
dete_survey_updated['separationtype'].value_counts()
```




    Resignation                         311
    Age Retirement                      285

    Contract Expired                     34
    Termination                          15
    Name: separationtype, dtype: int64




```python
# Select only the resignation separation types from each dataframe
dete_resignation = dete_survey_updated[dete_survey_updated['separationtype'] == 'Resignation'].copy()
tafe_resignation = tafe_survey_updated[tafe_survey_updated['separationtype'] == 'Resignation'].copy() 
```


## Verify the Data

Below, we clean and explore the cease_date and dete_start_date columns to make sure all of the years make sense. We'll use the following criteria:

* Since the cease_date is the last year of the person's employment and the dete_start_date is the person's first year of employment, it wouldn't make sense to have years after the current date. 
* Given that most people in this field start working in their 20s, it's also unlikely that the dete_start_date was before the year 1940.

    2011.0    116
    Name: cease_date, dtype: int64




Below are our findings:

* The years in both dataframes don't completely align. The `tafe_survey_updated` dataframe contains some cease dates in 2009, but the `dete_survey_updated` dataframe does not. The `tafe_survey_updated` dataframe also contains many more cease dates in 2010 than the `dete_survey_updated` dataframe. Since we aren't concerned with analyzing the results by year, we'll leave them as is.

## Create a New Column

Since our end goal is to answer the question below, we need a column containing the length of time an employee spent in their workplace, or years of service, in both dataframes.

* End goal: Are employees who have only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been at the job longer?

The `tafe_resignations` dataframe already contains a "service" column, which we renamed to `institute_service`.

Below, we calculate the years of service in the dete_survey_updated dataframe by subtracting the `dete_start_date` from the `cease_date` and create a new column named `institute_service`.


```python
# Calculate the length of time an employee spent in their respective workplace and create a new column
dete_resignation['institute_service'] = dete_resignation['cease_date'] - dete_resignation['dete_start_date']

#Quick check of the result
dete_resignation['institute_service'].head()
```




    3      7.0
    5     18.0
    8      3.0
    9     15.0
    11     3.0
    Name: institute_service, dtype: float64



## Identify Dissatisfied Employees

Next, we'll identify any employees who resigned because they were dissatisfied. Below are the columns we'll use to categorize employees as "dissatisfied" from each dataframe:

1. tafe_survey_updated:
    * Contributing Factors. Dissatisfaction
    * Contributing Factors. Job Dissatisfaction
2. dafe_survey_updated:
    * job_dissatisfaction
    * dissatisfaction_with_the_department
    * physical_work_environment
    * lack_of_recognition
    * lack_of_job_security
    * work_location
    * employment_conditions
    * work_life_balance
    * workload

If the employee indicated any of the factors above caused them to resign, we'll mark them as dissatisfied in a new column. After our changes, the new dissatisfied column will contain just the following values:

* True: indicates a person resigned because they were dissatisfied in some way
* False: indicates a person resigned because of a reason other than dissatisfaction with the job
* NaN: indicates the value is missing


```python
#Check the unique values
tafe_resignation['Contributing Factors. Dissatisfaction'].value_counts()
```




    -                                         277

    else:
        return True
tafe_resignation['dissatisfied'] = tafe_resignation[['Contributing Factors. Dissatisfaction', 
                                   'Contributing Factors. Job Dissatisfaction']].applymap(update_val).any(1, skipna = False)
tafe_resignation_up = tafe_resignation.copy()

#Check the unique values after the update
tafe_resignation_up['dissatisfied'].value_counts(dropna = False)

dete_resignation['dissatisfied'] = dete_resignation[['job_dissatisfaction',
       'dissatisfaction_with_the_department', 'physical_work_environment',
       'lack_of_recognition', 'lack_of_job_security', 'work_location',
       'employment_conditions', 'work_life_balance',
       'workload']].any(1, skipna=False)
dete_resignation_up = dete_resignation.copy()
dete_resignation_up['dissatisfied'].value_counts(dropna = False)
```




    False    162
    True     149
    Name: dissatisfied, dtype: int64



So far, we've accomplished the following:

* Renamed our columns
* Dropped any data not needed for our analysis
* Verified the quality of our data
* Created a new institute_service column
* Cleaned the Contributing Factors columns
* Created a new column indicating if an employee resigned because they were dissatisfied in some way

Now, we're finally ready to combine our datasets! Our end goal is to aggregate the data according to the institute_service column.

## Combining the Data
Below, we'll add an institute column so that we can differentiate the data from each survey after we combine them. Then, we'll combine the dataframes and drop any remaining columns we don't need.


```python
# Add an institue column
dete_resignation_up['institute'] = 'DETE'
tafe_resignation_up['institute'] = 'TAFE'
```


```python
# Combine the dataframes
combined = pd.concat([dete_resignation_up, tafe_resignation_up], ignore_index = True)

# Verify the number of non null values in each column
combined.notnull().sum().sort_values()
```

```python
# Drop columns with less than 500 non null values
combined_updated = combined.dropna(thresh = 500, axis = 1).copy()
```

## Clean the Service Column

Next, we'll clean the `institute_service` column and categorize employees according to the following definitions:

* New: Less than 3 years in the workplace
* Experienced: 3-6 years in the workplace
* Established: 7-10 years in the workplace
* Veteran: 11 or more years in the workplace

Our analysis is based on [this article](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171108006002/en/Age-Number-Engage-Employees-Career-Stage), which makes the argument that understanding employee's needs according to career stage instead of age is more effective.


```python
# Check the unique values
combined_updated['institute_service'].value_counts(dropna=False)
```

## Perform Some Initial Analysis

Finally, we'll replace the missing values in the `dissatisfied` column with the most frequent value, `False`. Then, we'll calculate the percentage of employees who resigned due to dissatisfaction in each `service_cat` group and plot the results.
Note that since we still have additional missing values left to deal with, this is meant to be an initial introduction to the analysis, not the final analysis.


```python
# Verify the unique values
combined_updated['dissatisfied'].value_counts(dropna = False)
```




    False    403
    True     240
    NaN        8
    Name: dissatisfied, dtype: int64




```python
# Replace missing values with the most frequent value, False
combined_updated['dissatisfied'] = combined_updated['dissatisfied'].fillna(False)
```


```python
# Calculate the percentage of employees who resigned due to dissatisfaction in each category
dis_pct = combined_updated.pivot_table(index='service_cat', values = 'dissatisfied')

# Plot the results
dis_pct.plot(kind='bar', rot = 30)
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/output_43_1.png" alt="">



From the initial analysis above, we can tentatively conclude that employees with 7 or more years of service are more likely to resign due to some kind of dissatisfaction with the job than employees with less than 7 years of service. However, we need to handle the rest of the missing data to finalize our analysis.
